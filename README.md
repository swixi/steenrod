# steenrod
A tool for doing computations in the dual Steenrod algebra (with the Milnor basis) and various quotients or subalgebras

## Features:

-Adem relations (mod 2)

-Coproducts in the Steenrod algebra and its dual, and in subalgebras of each

-Handling of tensor products

-Calculations in Brown-Gitler modules J(n), as described in [1]

-Calculate the "s" and "j" functions in [2], thus allowing the determination of various module structures on the subalgebra A(n), and potentially realization results

-Some TeX support

## Running:

The main user-interface loop is run from SelfMap.java.
